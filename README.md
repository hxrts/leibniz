This is a collection of R scripts for performing analysis on Are.na.

It uses the [spider](https://github.com/hxrts/spider) package to crawl Are.na and build a graph of channel connections.

From there you can build a text corpus of channel IDs with MCMC and then use that for topic modeling using word2vec.
